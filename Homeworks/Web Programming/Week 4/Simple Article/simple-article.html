			<p>I believe it's a myth that all cats are aloof and self-centered, but there are definitely times when they couldn't care less about what we think or want and just go about their business. Sure, they hear us when we address them, but they decide whether or not they want to respond. In short, sometimes cats just don't give a damn. Having company? Hoping to set a table that's not covered in cat hair? Wishful thinking, friend - you've got a new centerpiece, and it's appropriate for every season. Convenient, huh? Doesn't give a damn.
