								<h1>Best IDE Software – a List of the Top 10</h1>
								<img alt="ide" src="images/ide.png">
								<p>Whether you’re a seasoned developer or you’re just learning how to code, staying on top of the latest integrated development environments is a constant challenge. Truthfully, there is no best IDE for everyone. The best IDE is the IDE that works best for you, so below is a selection of 10 of the most popular choices to help you figure out which one to pick</p>
								<section id="difference">
									<h2>How is an IDE Different From a Text Editor?</h2>
									<p>An IDE is more than a simple text editor. While code-centric text editors such as Sublime or Atom offer many convenient features such as syntax highlighting, customizable interfaces and extensive navigation tools, they only allow you to write code. To make functioning applications, you at least need a compiler and a debugger.An IDE includes all of these components and then more. Some IDEs come with additional tools for automating, testing and visualizing the development process. The term “integrated development environment” means that you have everything you need to turn code into functioning apps and programs.Which is the best IDE on the market? The better question is: “Which is the best IDE for my purposes?” General factors to consider when choosing the best IDE include the languages it can support, ease of use and cost.Check out the list below outlining the features and drawbacks of each of the top 10 best IDE software programs.</p>
								</section>
